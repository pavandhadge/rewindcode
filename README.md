# Undotree

Undotree is a powerful VSCode extension designed to enhance the traditional undo-redo functionality by introducing a tree structure to track and navigate code changes more effectively. This extension provides developers with greater control over their development history, allowing them to view and restore previous versions of code without losing valuable information or trial-and-error attempts.

With Undotree, developers no longer need to worry about the linear limitations of the standard undo-redo system. Whether you want to revisit different approaches, compare versions, or navigate complex coding structures, Undotree is here to simplify the process.

## Features

- **Undo and Redo**: Navigate through different states of your code in a non-linear way using a tree structure.
- **Save and Advance**: Save a point in the tree and move forward, ensuring that all your significant changes are preserved.
- **Reset Tree**: Clear the undo tree and start fresh.
- **Selective Undo/Redo**: Select a piece of code, view all previous versions of that specific snippet, and choose the version you want to replace or copy.
- **Timecode Toggle**: Optionally display timecodes associated with different states for better tracking.

## Supported Languages

Undotree currently supports the following programming languages:

- **JavaScript (JS)**
- **TypeScript (TS)**
